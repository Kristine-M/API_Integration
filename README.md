This website will be able to show you information on any pokemon. All you have to do is navigate to the search page and input a pokemon name.
I made a personal change to the mini project requirements because though the direction called for a separate page showing a specific pokemon's
info, I found that it made more logical sense to put it on the same page as the search page as that is where we are retrieving the relevant 
data.
